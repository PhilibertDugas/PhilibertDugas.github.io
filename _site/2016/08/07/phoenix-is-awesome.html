  <h2 id="phoenix-is-awesome">Phoenix is awesome</h2>

<p><em>August 7th, 2016</em></p>

<p>This week was a fun one.
I took all the code I’ve been building the past few weeks and used it via a <a href="http://www.phoenixframework.org/">Phoenix</a> project.
Since I’m using Rails at my current workplace, Phoenix is like home to me. I love how easy it is to get started and focus on the application.</p>

<p>This post explains how I moved my code over to the phoenix project. It also covers a few issues that I stumbled over.</p>

<h4 id="starting-a-new-phoenix-project">Starting a new Phoenix project</h4>

<p>To get started with Phoenix, I followed the <a href="http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/up-and-running">Up and Running</a> section of the guide. Since I had already a Git repo named <a href="https://github.com/PhilibertDugas/elt">Elt</a>, I entered the following commands in my terminal:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nb">cd</span> ~/src/elt <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> mix phoenix.new .</code></pre></figure>

<p>Just as the expectations were, the whole project is created with these two commands. I’m always eager to see how it looks like, so I skipped through the rest of the documentation and tried to start the server.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">mix phoenix.server

<span class="o">[</span>error] Postgrex.Protocol <span class="o">(</span><span class="c">#PID&lt;0.203.0&gt;) failed to connect: ** (Postgrex.Error) tcp connect: connection refused - :econnrefused</span>
<span class="o">[</span>error] Postgrex.Protocol <span class="o">(</span><span class="c">#PID&lt;0.203.0&gt;) failed to connect: ** (Postgrex.Error) tcp connect: connection refused - :econnrefused</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Right, the server is configured by default to attempt a connection to a local postgres server on port 5432. Time to setup the database!</p>

<h4 id="database-setup">Database setup</h4>

<p>If you haven’t heard about <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>, I urge you to start reading about it. Docker recently launched <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/">Docker for Mac</a>  which works beautifully on laptop. Going to keep it simple for now as I want to focus on my Phoenix application, not on the database.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">docker run --name<span class="o">=</span>phoenix-db -p 5432:5432 -d postgres</code></pre></figure>

<p>This command will start a postgres server. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">-d</code> argument makes it so it’s a daemon process. This way I won’t have to keep a tab open all the time. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">-p 5432:5432</code> argument will forward any connection request on my laptop on port 5432 to the container’s 5432 port. Essentially it makes the postgres server visible on my laptop. We can try again running the server now that postgres is running.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">mix phoenix.server

<span class="o">[</span>error] Postgrex.Protocol <span class="o">(</span><span class="c">#PID&lt;0.195.0&gt;) failed to connect: ** (Postgrex.Error) FATAL (invalid_catalog_name): database "elt_dev" does not exist</span>
<span class="o">[</span>error] Postgrex.Protocol <span class="o">(</span><span class="c">#PID&lt;0.199.0&gt;) failed to connect: ** (Postgrex.Error) FATAL (invalid_catalog_name): database "elt_dev" does not exist</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Hmm, different error this time. Seems like the connection was established successfully, but there’s a database missing. Nothing to worry about. If I wasn’t so impatient, I would have read the doc and notice that I need to run the following command.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">mix ecto.create
The database <span class="k">for </span>Elt.Repo has been created</code></pre></figure>

<p>With this running, I can run again my server command and access my first Phoenix server!</p>

<h4 id="migrations">Migrations</h4>

<p>Now that I have my first server running, I want to be able to launch load tests from it. When the load test is over, I’ll store the results in Postgres so that we can see the stats. Here’s the basic metrics I want to store in Postgres:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Number of HTTP Requests</li>
  <li>Number of successful requests</li>
  <li>Average request time</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the perfect time for me to use a database migration, just like in Rails. There’s a really nice Phoenix task <code class="highlighter-rouge">phoenix.gen.html</code> which generates the Ecto model. Not only does it tackle the model, it also creates all the controller, views and templates associated with this model.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-elixir" data-lang="elixir"><span class="n">mix</span> <span class="n">phoenix</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">gen</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">html</span> <span class="no">LoadTest</span> <span class="n">load_tests</span> <span class="ss">amount_of_requests:</span><span class="n">integer</span> <span class="ss">amount_of_success:</span><span class="n">integer</span> <span class="ss">average_request_time:</span><span class="n">float</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This command generates the database migration as well as the html views needed to access it. The first argument <code class="highlighter-rouge">LoadTest</code> is the module name. The second argument is used for <code class="highlighter-rouge">resources</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">schema</code>. The remaining arguments define the columns used in the database. Note the the <code class="highlighter-rouge">average_request_time</code> is a float because we want to keep precision for the average request time. You can read more about this task in the doc right <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Mix.Tasks.Phoenix.Gen.Html.html">here</a></p>

<p>Running the migration afterward looks like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-elixir" data-lang="elixir"><span class="n">mix</span> <span class="n">ecto</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">migrate</span></code></pre></figure>

<h4 id="storing-the-state">Storing the state</h4>

<p>So far, I have the following aspects which are ready:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Database setup</li>
  <li>Ecto model migrated</li>
  <li>Default Phoenix views generated</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to launch a load test, I copied all my code from previous weeks into the <code class="highlighter-rouge">lib/elt</code> folder. I’m not sure if it should be placed here, but it will do the job for now. In the <a href="http://philibertd.com/2016/08/02/tracking-test-lifetime.html">post</a> last week, we refactored the code to detect the end of a test. This is great because we will know when we can record the test in the database. One problem is still there however. How can we retrieve the results? Of course they are currently logged into a file, but parsing the file is a terrible way to retrieve those results. What we need is a list containing all the results so that we can access them after the test.</p>

<p>I came up with a small module to keep the state of the result using an Elixir <a href="http://elixir-lang.org/docs/stable/elixir/Agent.html">Agent</a>:</p>

<noscript><pre>400: Invalid request
</pre></noscript>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/7a8d9da4bec95f224aa461b02de65206.js"> </script>

<p>This is a simple agent which will start with an empty list. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">put</code> function  will insert the value at the beginning of the list. <code class="highlighter-rouge">get_all</code> returns the current list while <code class="highlighter-rouge">clean</code> resets the list to empty.</p>

<p>Having this, we can adapt the <code class="highlighter-rouge">HTTPSender</code> to record all the entries in this list. We will be able to retrieve all the results later.</p>

</pre></noscript>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/05f7d27e09d7655e8ca98d19da8bf0c3.js"> </script>

<p>The important part here is line 14. We’re inserting in the list a tuple with the following format: <code class="highlighter-rouge"><span class="p">{</span><span class="err">boolean,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">float</span><span class="p">}</span></code>. This represents if the request was successful and it’s execution time in milliseconds. With this, we will be able to calculate the load test metrics and record it in Postgres.</p>

<h4 id="launching-the-load-test">Launching the load test</h4>

<p>Allright, time to get our hands dirty in the Phoenix code. Two things to do. First let’s define all the functions needed to calculate the load test stats.</p>

</pre></noscript>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/59b41928b0abb82c7252daecd2b52304.js"> </script>

<p>I added three methods to my module. Each of them are taking as an argument a list of tuple. Counting the requests is trivial, taking the length of the list does the trick.
Counting successes for a test isn’t hard either. Filter only the elemnts of the tuple which have <code class="highlighter-rouge">true</code> as boolean value, and take the length of the list.
Finally, counting the average request time is a two step function. First sum all the values for the <code class="highlighter-rouge">float</code> element of the tuple. Then divide this sum with the number of elements in the list.</p>

<p>The last step for this week was to connect all these pieces with the controller.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/dd38d8b95d9d3711fed43a47e6460602.js"> </script>

<p>On the <code class="highlighter-rouge">create</code> action, we want to execute the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Trigger a load test</li>
  <li>Retrieve the results</li>
  <li>Calculate the different metrics</li>
  <li>Store the metrics in Postgres.</li>
</ol>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Runner.main</code> launches the load test. Note that for now, the load test is pre-defined in a <code class="highlighter-rouge">JSON</code> file. In the future, I’m planning to offer a <code class="highlighter-rouge">JSON</code> editor or file uploader to edit the load test. Also, I added in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Runner.main</code> function the <code class="highlighter-rouge">List.Bucket.start_link</code> statement. It’s debatable if this should be in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Runner</code> module or directly in the controller. This is something I will have to think about.</p>

<p>Once the test is over, we retrieve the results with <code class="highlighter-rouge">List.Bucket.get_all</code>. Cleaning the bucket so that the next test starts with a fresh state as well. Calculate all the metrics via the functions defined earlier and finally store it in Postgres via Ecto.</p>

<h4 id="results">Results</h4>

<p>It’s a wrap for this week. Here’s what the final product looks like. Still a lot of work to be done, but it’s doing the job for now :)</p>
