  <h2 id="releasing-server-connections">Releasing server connections</h2>

<p><em>August 22nd, 2016</em></p>

<p>In the last blog post, I showed how I migrated my load testing tool to a web application.
Using the Phoenix framework, it was straight forward to get started and have early results.
The web application could trigger load test and display results.
While this was exciting to begin with, it presents an issue.
Waiting for a load test to finish can be a long process.
During that waiting time, we are holding a connection open to the server.
It wouldn’t be hard to open many tabs, and launch long running tests before the server starts blowing up.</p>

<p>This week, I focused on refactoring the code so that the connections to the server are released.
By refreshing a “progress” page, it’s possible to see if the test is still running.
In the world of Rails, it would be the equivalent of launching a job.</p>

<h4 id="launching-the-task">Launching the task</h4>

<p>I thought at first that this was going to be an easy thing to do, <strong>not so fast</strong>.
Phoenix doesn’t come with a job framework like <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_job_basics.html">Rails do</a>
With a little bit of research, I found some open source frameworks like <a href="https://github.com/akira/exq">exq</a>.
While some of these libraries are most likely the right solution long term, I wanted to try something simpler.</p>

<p>The simplest iteration I could think about was the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Trigger a load test with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">create</code> action</li>
  <li>Start an asynchronous job and redirect the user to a “in progress” page</li>
  <li>Verify the load test status when the user refreshes the “in progress” page</li>
</ol>

<p>Triggering a load test isn’t too hard, we’ve been doing this for the past few week.
Retrieving this load test in the context of another action was more challenging.
Essentially, we need a global state on the server side.</p>

<p>Having a global state is not a good idea when your application needs to scale, but it’s easy to implement.
Since I like to make small steps, I started this way.</p>

<p>This code snippet shows the <code class="highlighter-rouge">create</code> action of the controller. It starts by using <code class="highlighter-rouge">Task.start</code> to launch the load test.
We don’t need to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">Task.async</code> since we are not going to await for the end of this process in this function.
What we see afterward is storing the state in a global <code class="highlighter-rouge">Map</code>. Essentially, storing a hard-coded string as the key, with the task as the value.
This allows us to retrieve this task in another action. For this to work, we need some configuration in <code class="highlighter-rouge">lib/elt.ex</code></p>

<p>The important part of this section is at line 13. When the Phoenix server starts, it calls <code class="highlighter-rouge">Map.Bucket.start_link</code>.
It also makes this process supervised, meaning that it will be restarted if it crashes.
With this, we can store all our tasks in a global <code class="highlighter-rouge">Map</code></p>

<h4 id="retrieving-the-task">Retrieving the task</h4>

<p>Retrieving the task at this point is trivial. Simply query the map with the appropriate id to get the task.</p>

<p>Right now, the key is hardcoded with <strong>“1”</strong>. This needs to be changed and passed as a parameter to the function.
Once I retrieved the load test in another action, using <code class="highlighter-rouge">Process.alive?(pid)</code> tells me if the test is over or not.
This is a very simple check, and it could be elaborated further in the future.</p>

<p>If the process is still running, we render a “progress” page explaining how the load test is still running.
In the other case, we redirect the user to the list of results.</p>

<p>It’s always rewarding to see some results :)</p>

<h4 id="improvements">Improvements</h4>

<p>The current implementation works fine for quick development, but it’s worth thinking about potential improvements.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Using an external queue would allow better scalability</li>
  <li>Supervising the load tests to handle crashes and stuff</li>
  <li>Updating the “progress” page with websocket</li>
</ol>

<p>There’s many things that I look forward to, stay tuned for the progress of this project !</p>
